# Stop-Watch-System-with-Multiplexed-7-Segments
This repo implements a 1MHz ATmega32-based Stop Watch using Timer1 in CTC mode. Features six multiplexed common anode 7-segments controlled by 7447 decoders and NPN BJT transistors. External interrupts (INT0, INT1, INT2) handle reset, pause, and resume functions.
